#
# 🏈 BRAND VOICE & UX APPROACH
# ============================================================================
# This status page uses TuxedoDrive's friendly, supportive brand voice to help
# users understand their platform's health at a glance.
#
# Key design principles:
# 1. Emoji Icons: Each service has a clear emoji for quick visual identification
# 2. Service Categorization: Grouped by function (Core Platform, Payments, Email, etc.)
# 3. Helpful Descriptions: Comments explain what each service does and why it matters
# 4. Friendly Messaging: Intro text explains the page purpose in user-friendly language
# 5. Clear Action Items: Color codes (green/orange/red) guide users on what to do
# 6. Support-First Approach: Easy paths to get help when something goes wrong
#
# Services are organized in 8 logical categories:
# - 🏈 Internal Services (core platform & dashboards)
# - 💳 Payment Processing (financial transactions)
# - 📧 Email Services (confirmations & alerts)
# - 📱 SMS & Messaging (quick notifications)
# - 🔐 Authentication (login & security)
# - 🏗️ Infrastructure (hosting & deployment)
# - 🔒 Cloud Services (secrets & security)
# - ⚙️ Features (critical endpoints)
#
# 🔧 MAINTENANCE NOTES
# ============================================================================
# When REMOVING a service: Also delete history/, api/, and graphs/ artifacts.
# When ADDING external APIs: Test with curl first, use broad expectedStatusCodes.
# See AGENTS.md for full details.
